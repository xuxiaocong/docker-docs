> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

**Docker** 是一个用于开发、传输、运行App的开放平台。Docker可以帮助你将App从基础环境中分离，使你能够快速交付。使用Docker，你既可以管理你的基础环境也可以管理你的App。借助Docker在快速传输、测试、部署代码的优势，你可以显著得减少写代码到发布生产环境的时间。

## The Docker platform - Docker平台

> Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

Docker提供了一个可以在隔离环境中打包和运行App的能力，叫做 **容器（container）** 。由于独立且安全的特点，使你可以在一台主机中同时运行许多容器。容器是轻量级的，而且包含了运行App的所有东西，所以你不需要在当前主机中安装各种依赖环境。在工作时可以很方便得分享容器，而且分享的容器都按会相同的方式运行。

> Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:
> * Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
> * The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
> * When you’re ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.

Docker提供工具和平台管理容器的生命周期：
* 使用容器可以开发App及其支持组件；
* 容器可以成为App的分发和测试单元；
* 当你准备好App后，使用容器或编排服务部署到生产环境时，无论你的生产环境是使用本地数据中心、云厂商，或者两种方式一起使用，App都能以相同方式运行。

## What can I use Docker for? - 我能用Docker做什么？

> **Fast, consistent delivery of your applications**  
> Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.  
> Consider the following example scenario:  
> * Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers.  
> * They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests.  
> * When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.  
> * When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment.  

**快速的持续交付** 

开发者在Docker容器提供的标准化环境中开发，可以简化开发生命周期。容器有利于持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）工作流。

想象以下场景：
* 开发者们在本地环境中编写代码，使用Docker容器与同事协作；
* 他们使用Docker将App推送到测试环境，进行手工和自动化测试；
* 如果找到bug，他们可以在开发环境中修复这些bug，然后重新部署到测试环境中再次进行测试、验证；
* 测试全部通过后，通过更新生产环境的 **镜像（image）** 就可以解决客户的问题。

> **Responsive deployment and scaling**  
> Docker’s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.  
> Docker’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.  

**响应式部署和拓展**

以容器为基础的Docker平台具有高度可移植的特点。Docker容器可以运行在各种环境，无论是开发者的个人电脑、实体机、虚拟机、数据中心、云服务器、或者混合环境。

由于Docker的可移植性和轻量化，可根据业务需要动态管理工作负载，很方便地进行实时伸缩拓展App和服务。

> **Running more workloads on the same hardware**  
> Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.  

**在相同硬件中运行更多工作负载**

Docker轻量且快速。它比虚拟机更加可靠、更具性价比。你可以使用超过电脑本体的性能，以完成你的工作任务。Docker可以完美解决你需要使用更少的资源做更多事情的需求，如高密度环境和中小型程序部署。

## Docker architecture - Docker 结构

# 未完，分割线

> Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker *daemon* , which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

## The Docker daemon

> The Docker daemon (***dockerd***) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

## The Docker client

> The Docker client (***docker***) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to ***dockerd***, which carries them out. The ***docker*** command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

## Docker registries

> A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.  
> When you use the ```docker pull``` or ```docker run``` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the ```docker push``` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.

## Docker objects

> When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.

## Images

> An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ***ubuntu*** image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.  
> You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.

## Containers

> A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.  
> By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container’s network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.  
> A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.  

## Example ```docker run``` command

> The following command runs an ***ubuntu*** container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs ```/bin/bash```.

```shell
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```
