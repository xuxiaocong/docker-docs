> For the rest of this tutorial, we will be working with a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js. If you’re not familiar with Node.js, don’t worry. No real JavaScript experience is needed.  
> At this point, your development team is quite small and you’re simply building an app to prove out your MVP (minimum viable product). You want to show how it works and what it’s capable of doing without needing to think about how it will work for a large team, multiple developers, etc.

在这部分教程，我们使用Node.js编写的待办事项作为示例。如果你不熟悉node.js也没有关系，不会真正用到JavaScript的知识。

在这个点上，你的开发团队很小，并且你简单地创建一个app去实现 **最简化可行性产品（MVP minimum viable product）** 。你只需要知道它是如何工作的，而不需要思考它在一个拥有很多开发的大型团队是如何使用的等等琐事。

## Get the app - 获取app代码

> Before we can run the application, we need to get the application source code onto our machine. For real projects, you will typically clone the repo. But, for this tutorial, we have created a ZIP file containing the application.
> 1. [Download the App](https://github.com/docker/getting-started/tree/master/app) contents. You can either pull the entire project or download it as a zip and extract the app folder out to get started with
> 2. Once extracted, use your favorite code editor to open the project. If you’re in need of an editor, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You should see the ```package.json``` and two subdirectories ( ```src``` and ```spec``` ).

在运行示例app之前，我们需要先在我们电脑上获取源代码。在真实项目中，你通常是从代码库克隆。但是在这个示例中，我们已经创建了一个包含app的ZIP压缩包。

1. [下载app内容](https://github.com/docker/getting-started/tree/master/app)。你可以拉取整个项目，也可以下载zip压缩包并解压到文件夹中。
2. 获取到源代码后，用你最喜欢的代码编辑器打开这个项目。如果你还没有编辑器，你可以适应 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 。你可以看到 ```package.json``` 文件和两个子文件夹（ ```src``` 和 ```spec``` ）。

## Build the app’s container image - 创建app镜像

> In order to build the application, we need to use a ```Dockerfile``` . A Dockerfile is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to create a container image. If you’ve created Dockerfiles before, you might see a few flaws in the Dockerfile below. But, don’t worry. We’ll go over them.
> 1. Create a file named ```Dockerfile``` in the same folder as the file ```package.json``` with the following contents.

为了创建这个app，我们需要使用 ```Dockerfile``` 文件。Dockerfile是一个简单的创建容器镜像的以文本为基础的指令脚本。如果你之前使用过Dockerfile，你可能会看到下面的文件有一点小缺陷。别担心，我们会在稍后修复这些缺陷。

```
 # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
 FROM node:12-alpine
 RUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY . .
 RUN yarn install --production
 CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```
> Please check that the file ```Dockerfile``` has no file extension like ```.txt``` . Some editors may append this file extension automatically and this would result in an error in the next step.

请检查这个Dockerfile文件没有文件后缀名，如```.``` 。一些编辑器会自动添加文件后缀名，这会导致下个步骤中发生错误。

> 2. If you haven’t already done so, open a terminal and go to the ```app``` directory with the ```Dockerfile``` . Now build the container image using the docker build command.

如果你已经完成了上述操作，打开一个客户端，并进入这个带有 ```Dockerfile``` 文件的 ```app``` 文件夹。现在使用Docker创建命令创建容器镜像。

```shell
$  docker build -t getting-started .
```

> This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image. You might have noticed that a lot of “layers” were downloaded. This is because we instructed the builder that we wanted to start from the ```node:12-alpine``` image. But, since we didn’t have that on our machine, that image needed to be downloaded.  
> After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used ```yarn``` to install our application’s dependencies. The ```CMD``` directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.  
> Finally, the ```-t``` flag tags our image. Think of this simply as a human-readable name for the final image. Since we named the image ```getting-started``` , we can refer to that image when we run a container.  
> The ```.``` at the end of the ```docker build``` command tells that Docker should look for the ```Dockerfile``` in the current directory.  

## Start an app container - 启动一个容器

> Now that we have an image, let’s run the application. To do so, we will use the ```docker run``` command (remember that from earlier?).
> 1. Start your container using the ```docker run``` command and specify the name of the image we just created:

```shell
$ docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started
```

> Remember the ```-d``` and ```-p``` flags? We’re running the new container in “detached” mode (in the background) and creating a mapping between the host’s port 3000 to the container’s port 3000. Without the port mapping, we wouldn’t be able to access the application.

> 2. After a few seconds, open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) . You should see our app.

> 3. Go ahead and add an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove items. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend. Pretty quick and easy, huh?

> At this point, you should have a running todo list manager with a few items, all built by you. Now, let’s make a few changes and learn about managing our containers.
> If you take a quick look at the Docker Dashboard, you should see your two containers running now (this tutorial and your freshly launched app container).

## Recap

> In this short section, we learned the very basics about building a container image and created a Dockerfile to do so. Once we built an image, we started the container and saw the running app.
> Next, we’re going to make a modification to our app and learn how to update our running application with a new image. Along the way, we’ll learn a few other useful commands.
